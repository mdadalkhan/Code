/*01. There are 4 types of postion
    a. static - fixed at any point
    b. fixed -  fixed at any point
    c. relative - it occupy space and push others in the queue
    d. absolute - using left, right, top and bottom fixed the posion of the object and push it out of the normal flow
    e. sticky - must include top property
*/

/*
 * 01. Static = Default positioning of elements 
 */

 /*
  * 01. Fixed - Fixing an element in a positon using left,top,right,bottom
  * 
  * Difference between absolue and Fixed is that when we scroll fixed element does not affected. but absolue positioned elements are affected

  /*
   * Relative - by default it behave like static unless we use top, left, bottom ,right
   * it does not come out from default flow. 
   * z-index can be applied.
   *  keeps normal flow. using left top we can move
   * 
   * 
   */


  /*
   * Absolute
   * 01. Loose any reference - comes out of the flow. and shrinks to contents. come out from the parent 
   * 02. This element is moved from flow - contents will be shrink and position will be measured form Viewport
   * 03. z-index do not work
   * 
   *

   /*
    * combine absolute and relative
    * make children absolute and parent relative. then children cannot go beyond the parent. if relative in the parent is not defined then children will be absolute positon relative to body
