  The one problem we can encounter with breaking our Sass into
different files and controlling their output is that it can become very
difficult to debug our CSS when things go wrong. Thankfully, in Sass
3.3, source maps were introduced. You remember earlier when we
first compiled our Sass into CSS two files were created: style.css
and style.css.map? Well, the .css.map file is there to help us know
where our CSS rules are coming from. The Development Inspector
in most modern browsers would normally show us where a CSS rule
is coming from by telling us the line of the CSS file that is applying
that rule. That is no good to us when we have broken our Sass down
into different files. With Source Maps, when we compile our CSS
and view the end result in a browser, the Inspector will show us the
location of the Sass rules that are affecting that element:
