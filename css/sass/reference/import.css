  The one problem with this approach is that, if we are using Sass to
listen to changes in a folder, we will end up with CSS equivalents for
each of these files, even if we’d like to output them all into a single
CSS file. The way to avoid this is to use the underscore character
(_) at the start of each filename. This tells Sass we are treating this
as a partial file, to be included in other Sass files, but don’t want
to output it as CSS. We don’t need to use the underscore when
referencing the file in our Sass:
 */
 
 @media screen and (min-width: 640px) {
@import url(tablet.css) }


@media screen and (min-width: 640px) {
@import 'views-tablet'; }

// file _forms.scss
@import 'forms';
