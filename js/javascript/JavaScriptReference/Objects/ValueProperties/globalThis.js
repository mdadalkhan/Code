/* Description Historically, accessing the global object has required
different syntax in different JavaScript environments. On the web you can use
window, self, or frames - but in Web Workers only self will work. In Node.js
none of these work, and you must instead use global. The this keyword could be
used inside functions running in nonâ€“strict mode, but this will be undefined
in Modules and inside functions running in strict mode. You can also use
Function('return this')(), but environments that disable eval(), like CSP in
browsers, prevent use of Function in this way.

The globalThis property provides a standard way of accessing the global this
value (and hence the global object itself) across environments. Unlike similar
properties such as window and self, it's guaranteed to work in window and
non-window contexts. In this way, you can access the global object in a
consistent manner without having to know which environment the code is being
run in. To help you remember the name, just remember that in global scope the
this value is globalThis.








HTML and the WindowProxy In many engines globalThis will be a reference to the
actual global object, but in web browsers, due to iframe and cross-window
security considerations, it references a Proxy around the actual global object
(which you can't directly access). This distinction is rarely relevant in
common usage, but important to be aware of.
 





Naming Several other popular name choices such as self and global were removed
from consideration because of their potential to break compatibility with
existing code. See the language proposal's "naming" document for more details.




Examples Search for the global across environments Prior to globalThis, the
only reliable cross-platform way to get the global object for an environment
was Function('return this')(). However, this causes CSP violations in some
settings, so es6-shim uses a check like this, for example:



 */ 

var getGlobal = function () {
  if (typeof self !== 'undefined') { return self; }
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { return window; }
  if (typeof global !== 'undefined') { return global; }
  throw new Error('unable to locate global object');
};

var globals = getGlobal();

if (typeof globals.setTimeout !== 'function') {
  // no setTimeout in this environment!
}


// With globalThis available, the additional search for the global across environments is not necessary anymore:
