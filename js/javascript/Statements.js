 /*     
with (expression) statement;

The with statement sets the scope of the code within a particular object. The syntax is as follows:
with (expression) statement;
The with statement was created as a convenience for times when a single object was being coded to over
and over again, such as in this example:
var qs = location.search.substring(1);
var hostName = location.hostname;
var url = location.href;
Here, the location object is used on every line. This code can be rewritten using the with statement as
follows:
with(location){
var qs = search.substring(1);
var hostName = hostname;
var url = href;
}

just a replacement
