/* NodeList objects are collections of nodes, usually returned by properties
such as Node.childNodes and methods such as document.querySelectorAll(). */

/* Although NodeList is not an Array, it is possible to iterate over it with
forEach(). It can also be converted to a real Array using Array.from().

However, some older browsers have not implemented NodeList.forEach() nor
Array.from(). This can be circumvented by using Array.prototype.forEach() â€”
see this document's Example. */


// Live vs. Static NodeLists
// Although they are both considered NodeLists, there are 2 varieties of NodeList: live and static.


// Live NodeLists
// In some cases, the NodeList is live, which means that changes in the DOM automatically update the collection.


//For example, Node.childNodes is live:


const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
let child_nodes = parent.childNodes;
console.log(child_nodes.length); // let's assume "2"
parent.appendChild(document.createElement('div'));
console.log(child_nodes.length); // outputs "3"


// Static NodeLists In other cases, the NodeList is static, where any changes in
// the DOM does not affect the content of the collection. The ubiquitous
// document.querySelectorAll() method returns a static NodeList.

// It's good to keep this distinction in mind when you choose how to iterate over
// the items in the NodeList, and whether you should cache the list's length.



// Properties

NodeList.length //The number of nodes in the NodeList.

// Methods


NodeList.item() // Returns an item in the list by its index, or null if the index is out-of-bounds. An alternative to accessing nodeList[i] (which instead returns  undefined when i is out-of-bounds). This is mostly useful for non-JavaScript DOM implementations.
NodeList.entries() //Returns an iterator, allowing code to go through all key/value pairs contained in the collection. (In this case, the keys are numbers starting from 0 and the values are nodes.)
NodeList.forEach() // Executes a provided function once per NodeList element, passing the element as an argument to the function.
NodeList.keys() // Returns an iterator, allowing code to go through all the keys of the key/value pairs contained in the collection. (In this case, the keys are numbers starting from 0.)
NodeList.values() //Returns an iterator allowing code to go through all values (nodes) of the key/value pairs contained in the collection.


// Example - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList

// It's possible to loop over the items in a NodeList using a for loop 

for (let i = 0; i < myNodeList.length; i++) {
  let item = myNodeList[i];
}



// Don't use for...in to enumerate the items in NodeLists, since they will also
// enumerate its length and item properties and cause errors if your script
// assumes it only has to deal with element objects. Also, for..in is not
// guaranteed to visit the properties in any particular order.


//for...of loops will loop over NodeList objects correctly:

const list = document.querySelectorAll('input[type=checkbox]');
for (let checkbox of list) {
  checkbox.checked = true;
}



// Recent browsers also support iterator methods (forEach()) as well as
// entries(), values(), and keys().

//There is also an Internet Explorer-compatible way to use
//Array.prototype.forEach for iteration:

const list = document.querySelectorAll('input[type=checkbox]');
Array.prototype.forEach.call(list, function (checkbox) {
  checkbox.checked = true;
});
